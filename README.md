# Overview

**Description of the Software**

The Quiz Application is a user-friendly software designed for taking quizzes on diverse topics. With an intuitive interface, users can explore categories such as general knowledge, pop culture, science, and history. Immediate feedback on responses enhances the interactive learning experience. I also added the score borad to track the progress and make it even more engaging. 

**Purpose for Creating the Software**
Creating the Quiz Application serves to enhance my skills in GUI development, event-driven programming, object-oriented programming, problem-solving, and code organization. This project provides practical experience and prepares me for more advanced software engineering tasks.

# Development Environment

**Programming Language**

The software was written in C#, a versatile and widely-used programming language known for its simplicity, strong typing, and extensive support for object-oriented programming paradigms. C# was chosen for its suitability for developing desktop applications with the .NET framework, offering robust features for GUI development and event-driven programming.

**Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**
Microsoft Visual Studio Code served as the integrated development environment (IDE) for coding, testing, and debugging the software. Its user-friendly interface, extensive plugin ecosystem, and built-in Git integration streamlined the development workflow, enabling efficient collaboration and version control management.

**Version Control**
Git was utilized for version control management, allowing for tracking changes, collaborating with team members, and maintaining code integrity throughout the development lifecycle. The integration of Git within VS Code provided seamless version control functionality, facilitating effective collaboration and code management.
